# Neural-Dimensionality-Reduction
Performing dimensionality reduction with a neural network:

- In this notebook we will build two neural networks to try and perform dimesionality reduction on the MNIST dataset
- The code is easily gereralizable for every dataset but you'll have to find the right structure of the NN
- No more chatter, let's get into it!
