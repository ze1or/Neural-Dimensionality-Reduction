# Neural-Dimensionality-Reduction
Performing dimensionality reduction with a neural network:

- The reader is assumed to be familiar with some basic concepts of Machine learning such as dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, MDS, SNE, t-SNE...) and Deep learning concepts like MLP and everything around them.
- In this notebook we will build two neural networks to try and perform dimesionality reduction on the MNIST dataset.
- The code is easily gereralizable for every dataset but you'll have to find the right structure of the NN.
- No more chatter, let's get into it!
